TODO
====

 * Make the 'Task' only have the .execute() and .finished() methods and move
   the executing logic into an 'Executor' class.
 * The 'Tasks' will be added to the 'Executor' and given their environment and
   dependencies there. (Maybe wrap the Task with the other stuff in an object?)
 * Move some of the more generic Tasks (like the Git ones) into Microbuild
   itself
 * For the Tasks that just have dependencies, those should really be declaring
   their own 'sub-build' with a new Executor and a .finished() which checks
   that the last step is complete (or just being a function that builds up
   the single Executor).
 * Maybe 'Executor' should be called 'Build'?
